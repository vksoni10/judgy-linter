Judgy Linter
A hilarious VS Code extension that adds a touch of judgment and a meme to your coding process. This linter provides instant feedback on your code's quality, not with a boring list of errors, but with a meme.

‚ú® Features
Meme-Powered Linter: Get a different meme based on your code's error count.

Automatic Activation: The linter runs automatically every time you save a file.

Manual Command: Use the Command Palette to run the linter on demand for the active file.

Multi-Language Support: Works with any language that has a VS Code linter extension providing diagnostics (e.g., Python, Java, C/C++, TypeScript, etc.).

üöÄ How to Use
Install the Extension: Find and install "Judgy Linter" from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

Start Coding: Open any file and start writing code.

Automatic Linting: Just save the file (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S) and watch the magic happen! A Webview panel will pop up with a witty comment and a meme.

Manual Activation: If you want to check your progress without saving, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P), type Judgy Linter: Show Meme, and hit Enter.

üñºÔ∏è Example Output
If you have 5 errors, you might see this:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://placehold.co/400x200/555/FFF?text=That's+5+errors.+You're+trying+to+get+a+bug+bounty,+aren't+you?" />
</p>

If you have no errors, the linter might get a little suspicious:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://placehold.co/400x200/555/FFF?text=No+errors.+Did+you+copy+this+from+Stack+Overflow?" />
</p>

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
Visual Studio Code API - The core framework for building the extension.

TypeScript - The language used for development.
